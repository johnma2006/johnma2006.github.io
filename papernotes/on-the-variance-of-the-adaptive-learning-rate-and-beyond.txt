- The learning rate warmup heuristic achieves remarkable success in stabilizing training, accelerating convergence, and improving generalization for Adam
- Identify a problem with Adam -- due to lack of samples in the early stage, the variance of the adaptive learning rate (:= sqrt(1 / adam_var)) is problematically large, and warmup works as a variance reduction technique
