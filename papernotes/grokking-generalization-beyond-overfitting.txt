#### Results

<img src="papernotes/figures/grokking-generalization-beyond-overfitting-1.jpg" width="400" />

- Generalization can seemingly spontaneously occur much after the point of fitting the training data perfectly
- Intuition: after fitting the training data, optimization tries to find the min norm solution

#### Methodology

- Fit a small transformer on binary tables such as f(x, y) = x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + xy + x (mod 97)
