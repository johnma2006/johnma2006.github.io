- Perform ablations, and a lot of them.
	- Start with a bare implementation of some base model like a transformer. Train it for a long time. Make a small tweak. Train it again. Make another small tweak and train it again.
	- Track down the effect of all ablations
- This is why I really enjoy reading the ablations sections of any research paper: it gives me a sense for what actually matters, and how much of a result is simply due to the implementation choices a researcher chose.
