#### Methodology
- Instead of computing a formula for how to scale weights in terms of the dim of particular layers (a la Kaiming, Xavier), this algorithm instead takes an empirical approach
- Feed a batch of input data through the network layer-by-layer
- Scale the weights of each layer until the scale of that layer's outputs is sufficiently close to 1
