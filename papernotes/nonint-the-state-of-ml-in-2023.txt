- Where models fall short:
	- DALL-E 3: can't tell left from right, can't count past three
	- Text: not great at providing specific instructions
	- Coding: can't design systems above a certain complexity
	- Audio: weak at conversation, sounds robotic
- Common themes with the above shortcomings:
	- (1) Lack of data in the specific domain
	- (2) Failure to generalize at the semantic level (e.g. rendering images of hands with 5 fingers)
- Scaling compute directly addresses the above two points
	- (1) Fit the data manifold more precisely
	- (2) Raw compression
