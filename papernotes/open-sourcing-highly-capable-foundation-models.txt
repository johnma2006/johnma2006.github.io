#### Risks of Open Source

- Highly capable model shave the potential for extreme risks
	- Malicious actors mgiht apply highly capable systems to help build new bio/chemical weapons, or to mount cyberattacks against critical infrastructure
	- Disseminate targetted misinformation at scale or enact population surveillance

#### Offense-defense balance

- Open source is helpful in addressing some rsisks, but could overall exacerbate the extreme risks that highly capable AI models may pose
	- For traditional software, open-sourcing facilitates defensive activities to guard against miuse more so than it facilitates offensive misuse by malicious actors
	- However, the offense-defense balance for LLMs skew more towards offense for the following reasons:
		- Open sourcing allows malicious actors to disable safeguards against misuse, and introduce new dangerous capabilities through fine-tuning
		- Open sourcing greatly increase attacker knowledge of possible exploits
		- Researching safety vulnerabilities is difficult, and fixes are not straightforward
