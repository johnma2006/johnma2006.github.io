#### Results

- Influence function measures how the modelâ€™s behaviors change if a given training point were added to the training set?
- Examples:

#### Summary of main findings

- Influence is heavy tailed, but spread out over many datapoints, suggesting that model behaviours do not result from direct memorization
- Larger models generalize at a more abstract level than smaller models
- Role-playing behaviour is influence primarily by examples of similar behaviours, suggesting that these behaviours result from imitation rather than sophisticated planning
