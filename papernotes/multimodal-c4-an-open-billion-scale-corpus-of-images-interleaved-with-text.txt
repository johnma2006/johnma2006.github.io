#### Motivation

- Image-text models like Flamingo support in-context learning via interleaving of images/text
- Require pretraining on similarly interleaved sequences of images and text, as opposed to image-text pair datasets like LAION

#### Dataset: mmc4 (multimodal C4)

- Variants:
	- fewer-faces: remove images with faces to protect privacy
	- core: smaller, higher-precision subset with stricter filtering and higher image-text similarity

#### Collection Methodology

- (1) Initial data collection
	- Expansion of text-only C4 dataset, which has been cleaned via English-identification, deduplication, and obscenity filtering
- (2) Gathering images
	- Retrieve original webpages for each c4-en document. Eliminate c4-en documents with no downloadable images
	- Extract image URLs (filter to png/jpeg/jpg, exclude urls with logo, button, icon, plugin, widget)
	- Download images, resize to 800px
- (3) De-duplication + small resolution
	- Duplicate image detection using opennota's phash; remove duplicates
	- Discard images with width or height < 150px (small icons, nav buttons)
	- Discard images with apect ratio > 2 (banner ads)
- (4) NSFW image filtering
	- NSFW detection using DataComp's NSFW classifier: 4-layer MLP trained on LAION 2B NSFW dataset with input features extracted from CLIP-ViT
	- Remove images with predicted NSFW prob > 10%
- (5) Aligning images and sentences
	- Assign images to sentences using bipartite linear assignment
	- Use CLIP-ViT model to estimate bipartite weights := cosine similarity between image and sentence

#### Applications:

- Used mmc4 to train OpenFlamingo
