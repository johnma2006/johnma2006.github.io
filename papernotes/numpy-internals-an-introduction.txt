#### Numpy Arrays and Metadata

- Arrays in Numpy have essentially 2 parts:
	- (1) the data buffer that contains the actual raw data
	- (2) array metadata, containing the stride, datatype, F or C order, ...
- Much of the flexibility of NumPy is because of the array metadata
	- The data buffer can be interpreted in many ways without being recreated
- Summation over rows is 2x as fast when the array is stored in row-major (C-order) compared to column-major (F-order), because contiguous memory accesses are faster
