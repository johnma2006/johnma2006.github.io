#### NN inductive biases
- Biased towards smooth solutions
- Invariant to a rotation of the features (at least MLPs are), and they show that uniformative features affect MLP-like NNs more than tree methods.
	- Therefore, to remove uninformative features, an algorithm first has to find the original orientation.
