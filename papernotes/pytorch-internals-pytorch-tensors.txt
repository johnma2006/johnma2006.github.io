#### PyTorch Tensors

- A tensor is determined by 3 things:
	- (1) Device: where the tensor is stored (e.g. CPU or GPU)
	- (2) Layout: how do we logically interpret this physical memory; the most common is a strided tensor, but sparse tensors have a different layout
	- (3) Dtype: what is actually stored in each element of the tensor

#### Strided Representation

- Strides are the fundamental basis by which PyTorch provides views
	- Layout is given by (shape, stride, offset)
- Given 2D tensor t, the element at t[i, j] is in physical memory location given by dot product of (i, j) and the stride

- Slicing a row using offset

- Slicing a col using stride

- Other:
	- Broadcasting: stride is 0
	- Transposing: reverse the strides
	- Flip: negative strides
